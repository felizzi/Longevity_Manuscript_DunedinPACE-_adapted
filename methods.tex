\subsection{Review of the endpoints used in longevity trials}

We began with a PubMed and Google Scholar review of the main trials used in Longevity Medicine, to find out the key endpoints that are relevant for our analytic model and decision-making framework. We did not do a systematic review, because the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, OutcomeS) criteria are very wide, so the number of hits might be too big, and therefore difficult to handle even for new AI-based solutions. Our target population includes all adults, with no age limit. The Intervention of interest is any drug, monitoring -- including digital health, and lifestyle change. The comparator is anything, which can mean either maintaining the current lifestyle or making it worse. The outcomes are what we are looking for. These can include endpoints such as death, the occurrence of specific diseases or quality of life questionnaires. The large scope of the search terms made us do a focused review, based on key studies that showed the endpoints that were used before in trials targeting longevity. So, to help us choose the trials and endpoints to consider, we used two reviews. One paper explains the pros and cons of the longevity-relevant endpoints, with the goal to provide complete recommendations on the trial designs in longevity and their relevant endpoints. It also talks about the potential surrogate endpoints, which can help us overcome the limitations of endpoints that need a very long time to produce a number of events that can eventually lead to the sufficient significance and statistical power to determine if the intervention included in the trial works\cite{Cummings2022}. Another more recent study builds on the previous work and proposes new biomarker-related endpoints that can serve as surrogate. The authors present a complete list of ongoing or finished trials, with interventions ranging from pharmacological to lifestyle changes and novel endpoints such as those linked to DNA methylation\cite{Moqri2023}.

\subsection{Frailty Index and its relationship to the prevalence of frailty}

The frailty index is a comprehensive metric designed to assess the vulnerability of older adults by quantifying their health status across a spectrum of clinical deficits. Typically, this index encompasses a wide range of health deficits---often 30 to 40---encompassing symptoms, diseases, disabilities, and laboratory abnormalities. Each deficit is evaluated, and the index is calculated by dividing the number of deficits present in an individual by the total number of deficits assessed, yielding a score between 0 and 1. A higher score indicates a higher degree of frailty.

The definition of frailty in a clinical context is based on established cutoff scores that determine a person's health classification. Typically, individuals with a frailty index of 0.25 or higher are labeled as "frail," signifying a high chance of negative health events. On the other hand, an index ranging from 0.10 to 0.24 usually places an individual in the "pre-frail" category, which indicates a moderate risk level and represents an important opportunity for early intervention and preventative strategies.

The distribution of the frailty index across different age groups enables researchers and clinicians to determine the proportion of subjects who are considered frail or pre-frail within each group. This stratification provides invaluable insights into how frailty prevalence changes with age, assisting in the allocation of healthcare resources and the design of targeted interventions. Such measures aim to mitigate the progression of frailty, thereby enhancing health outcomes and quality of life in the aging population.

Several studies have characterised the relationship between Frailty Index and the prevalence of frailty at a given age.

Rockwood et al. characterized the distribution of frailty index in human and mice as a function of age and built an association between incremental Frailty Index scores and a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality\cite{Rockwood2017}. Rockwood and Howlett later showed that the Frailty Index distribution fits a gamma distribution for younger ages, with a long right tail, indicating some younger people have many health problems. However, as people age, the distribution becomes normal, showing how health problems are not just for a few, but affect everyone\cite{Rockwood2019}. These observations were confirmed by a longitudinal study in Korea, characterizing the evolution of the distributions of Frailty Index as a function of age and showed that the median Frailty Index is approximately 0.5 among females aged 95-98\cite{Baek2022}. In determining the proportion of frail people at a given age, we calculate the proportion of subjects above the 0.25 Frailty Index threshold, as per definition. We perform a normal approximation of the gamma distribution and calculate the proportion of frail subjects at each age as

\begin{equation}
\pi_{x}^{frail} = 1 - \Phi\left( \frac{0.25\  - \ {FI}_{x}}{\sigma_{x}^{FI}} \right)
\end{equation}

Being $\pi_{x}^{frail}$ the proportion of frail subject at age x, ${FI}_{x}$ the Frailty Index at age x, $\sigma_{x}^{FI}$ the standard deviation of the Frailty Index at age x and $\Phi(.)$ the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Development}

In this section, we explain the data sources and methods used to meet the goals of the manuscript. As we mentioned, one main challenge of using Frailty as an endpoint is that it occurs relatively late in life, with trials like the DO-HEALTH trial enrolling subjects older than 65 (70) years old\cite{McNeil2018}. Therefore, finding studies that target individuals younger than 65 is crucial. Several studies, including the CALERIE trial reported the effects of dietary interventions on younger subjects (less than 50 years old)\cite{Waziry2023}. The work by Mak et al.\cite{Mak2023} modelled the evolution of \textit{Frailty Index} as a function of the evolution of five epigenetic clocks, including clocks that assess the current estimate of biological age (PCHorvathAge, PCHannumAge, PCPhenoAge, PCGrimAge, DunedinPACE) and clocks that assess the speed or pace of ageing, e.g. the DunedinPACE clock. The study focuses on subjects older than 50 years old, thus enabling the generation of evidence for more than an additional decade compared to the early studies (for example\cite{McNeil2018}). From a modelling standpoints, the study used a Dual-Change-Score-Model\cite{Wiedemann2022} to model the dependencies between Frailty Index and the epigenetic clocks. Importantly, the study demonstrated how changes in the proportion of frail subjects in a population, as affected by the value of recorded Frailty Indices, are influenced by the current proportion of frail individuals and by the value of a specific epigenetic clock.

Their study concluded that there is no statistically significant relationship between any of the clocks measuring the estimate of biological age, but there is a dependency between Frailty and DunedinPACE. The authors estimated the parameters affecting the relationship between DunedinPACE and Frailty Index, with a one-directional coupling effect DunedinPACE â†’ Frailty (reported in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}).

The structure of the model identified by Mak and coworkers is described by the Equation (\ref{eq:delta_fi})

\begin{equation}\label{eq:delta_fi}
{\mathrm{\Delta}FI}_{t} = \ \alpha \cdot {FI}_{S} + \beta_{FI} \cdot {FI}_{t - 1} + \gamma_{Clock \rightarrow FI} \cdot {Clock}_{t - 1}
\end{equation}

Where a 2-year cycle is assumed (thus the time gap between two consecutive cycles t-1 and t is 2 years) and the parameters and their descriptions are outlined in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}.

According to the modeling assumptions of Mak and colleagues, the change in DunedinPACE over time is a linear function of age, which can be described by the equation below:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:delta_clock}
{\mathrm{\Delta}Clock}_{t} = \ \beta_{Clock} + {Clock}_{t - 1}
\end{equation}

We extend the quantitative model by Mak and colleagues to determine how changes in the profile of the DunedinPACE Clock affect changes in the Frailty Index over a 40-year time period, namely between 50 and 90 years of age.

\end{table}

We construct three different types of evolution of the DunedinPACE clock, which depend on assumptions on the evolution of the evidence base. The three scenarios are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Interventions, such as caloric restrictions (as from the CALERIE study) lead to a reduction of DunedinPACE of 0.01 with respect to the expected DunedinPACE evolution (cite CALERIE) as a function of age. This can be seen as a simple shift of the DunedinPACE evolution along the y-axis. (Figure~\ref{fig:clocks_frailty}) [CR0]. 
    
    \item In addition to a shift on the y-axis, interventions affect the slope of the natural evolution of DunedinPACE, thus reducing the rate of growth of the speed of aging year-on-year [CR1].
    
    \item A third scenario is based on the identification of a spectrum of interventions, which will set the pace of aging exactly at 1.0 (the natural speed of aging) or slightly below [CR2]. 
\end{enumerate}

The three scenarios outlined above are linked to the evolution of \textit{Frailty Index} as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:clocks_frailty}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Figure3.png}
\caption{Overview of the evolution of the DunedinPACE clock (left panel) and Frailty Index (right panel) as a function of Age. The blue line corresponds to the baseline evolution of DunedinPACE as a function of age. The orange line corresponds to the putative evolution with changes in DunedinPACE only governed by the findings of the CALERIE trial, i.e. a shift of 0.01 applied to the y-axis only [CR0]. The green line assumes that changes in diet and lifestyle govern both the offset on the y-axis and the slope of the frailly line as a function of age [CR1], while the red line corresponds to a scenario in which individuals manage to keep their DunedinPACE clock value constantly at 1.0 [CR2], thereby leading to a favorable evolution of Frailty Index.}
\label{fig:clocks_frailty}
\end{figure}

As outlined in Section 2.2, the link between Frailty Index and the prevalence of frailty is governed by Equation (1). After calibrating the value of the standard deviation $\sigma_{x}^{FI}$ to match the curves representing the proportion of frailty as a function of age observed in a Dutch study\cite{Hoogendijk2019}, we obtain the curves as in Figure~\ref{fig:frailty_proportion}.

\subsection{Estimation of the lifespan changes depending on Frailty}

We use mortality data from selected countries (e.g. Switzerland)\cite{Ruckstuhl2023} to measure how the survival function changes according to changes in the fraction of frail people in the general population. We construct two survival curves $S_{x}^{robust}$ and $S_{x}^{frail}$, which show the probability of survival of robust and frail people respectively. To connect the robust and frail populations, we use the relationship between the force of mortality $\mu_{x}$ for the two populations. The relationship between the force of mortality, or hazard, of the robust and the frail population has been studied extensively in recent years. Peng et al. did a systematic review that showed the risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in frail and robust people living in the community. The authors found a hazard ratio of 2.40, which represents the higher risk of frail people dying from any cause compared to robust people\cite{Peng2022}. This is described by the equation below

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hazard_ratio}
\frac{\mu_{x}^{frail}}{\mu_{x}^{robust}} = {HR}_{\frac{frail}{robust}} = 2.40\ 
\end{equation}

Where $\mu_{x}^{frail}$ and $\mu_{x}^{robust}$ represent the hazard functions at age $x$ for the frail and the robust populations respectively. Starting off from the general population mortality, we construct new survival curves that separate out the robust and frail individuals from the general population. Our assumption here is that the hazard ratio of frail vs non-frail is constant over time and does not depend on age. In this fashion, we obtain two distinct survival curves, one representing the population as if all the individuals were frail and one representing the population as if everyone was robust. The standard relationship linking Survival and hazard is well known\cite{Kleinbaum2012}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:survival_hazard}
\mu_{x} = - \log\left( \frac{S_{x + 1}}{S_{x}} \right)
\end{equation}

In our work we relied on this discrete approximation of the number of death events at each year and built survival curves that capture the contribution of both the frail and the non-frail populations. This is achieved by building a survival curve including both frail and non-frail as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:survival_total}
{S_{x}^{total} = \pi_{x}^{frail}S}_{x}^{frail}{+ \left( 1 - \pi_{x}^{frail} \right)S}_{x}^{robust}
\end{equation}

Where $\pi_{x}^{frail}$ is the proportion of frail people at age $x$, which changes according to the scenarios outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:frailty_proportion}. Since our analysis focuses on subjects older than 50 years old, we have $S_{50}^{robust} = S_{50}^{frail} = S_{50}^{total} = 1$ (in standard mortality tables this value is actually 1e5). Let $D_{x}$ be the number of deaths at age $x$. A proportion of these deaths is attributable to frailty and a proportion will be among robust people. By factoring in the evolution of the proportion of frail people over time $\pi_{x}^{frail}$ in Equation~\eqref{eq:survival_hazard} and accounting for the Hazard Ratio outlined in Equation~\eqref{eq:hazard_ratio}, we can build independent survival curves for the frail and non-frail populations (see Results section).

We have now shown how changes in epigenetic clocks, such as DunedinPACE, can affect changes in frailty, which in turn affect changes in the expected survival or lifespan. We will investigate how changes in DunedinPACE can be achieved with caloric restriction, as demonstrated by the CALERIE trial, which had a relatively short follow up time of 2 years.

\subsection{Value and savings to Healthcare systems}

In order to demonstrate the effects of changes in Frailty in the overall healthcare system costs, we relied on a study comparing the costs born to selected healthcare systems in frail vs. robust subjects, addressing frailty as an overall health burden\cite{Hoogendijk2019}. Notably, the authors outline an increase in spending in Frail subjects compared to robust subjects. The frailty instruments used were not consistent among the various resources utilized. In a Study carried out in the Netherlands, the authors used the Groningen Frailty Indicator and used healthcare insurance data to show an increase in mean annual costs of approximately EUR 15000 in frail subjects compared to non-frail subjects aged 65 and above\cite{Peters2015}. In the USA, hospital registration data showed additional costs in the 6 months following colorectal surgery slightly below USD 50000 if frail subjects vs robust subjects aged 65 and above\cite{Robinson2011}. A minor difference was observed in a study which gathered data from a government database in Australia. Among patients with a mean age of 79.5 years, frail patients showed mean total health-care costs increase in the 6 months post hospital admission approximately AUD 9000 higher compared to non-frail patients\cite{Comans2016}.

Costs have been converted to 2024 costs in Switzerland (CHF) based on the cumulative inflation since the year of observation (Year column - Table~\ref{tab:costs}) and 2024, the currency conversion rate and an adjustment for the cost of living between Switzerland and the listed countries. The inflation rate for Australia has been extracted from the Australian Bureau of Statistics\cite{ABS2023}. The inflation rate for the USA has been extracted from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics\cite{BLS2024} and the inflation rate for the Netherlands has been extracted from Statistics Netherlands (CBS)\cite{CBS2024}. The purchasing parity conversion was extracted from the OECD Purchasing Power Parities for GDP and related indicators table\cite{OECD}. The exchange rate of CHF to AUD and USD have been sourced from the Swiss National Bank\cite{SNB}.

\label{tab:costs}
\end{table}

While the study in the Netherlands shows a direct impact on total annual healthcare costs, which can be directly translated to potential savings for decision-makers, the studies in the US and Australia are focused on post-operative costs for selected categories. These costs are difficult to translate into potential direct savings for a healthcare system. A study in Switzerland calculated the proportion of people admitted to hospital according to frail status, showing that the incidence of hospital admission over a 10-year period is approximately 6-fold higher in frail or pre-frail people compared to robust individuals\cite{Luini2023}. Nonetheless, since the specific focus of this study is on a population admitted to hospital, we believe its findings are not applicable to our context.

\subsection{Value to individuals}

In this section, we outline the economic framework to value improvements in lifespan and health span, as outlined in the work by Murphy and Topel\cite{Murphy2006} and Scott et al.\cite{Scott2023a,Scott2023b}. The work defines the lifetime utility for an individual of age $a$, defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lifetime_utility}
utility(a) = \int_{a}^{\infty}{H(t)u\left( c(t),l(t) \right)\widetilde{S}}(t,a)e^{- \rho(t - a)}dt
\end{equation}

Were the elements of the Equation~\eqref{eq:lifetime_utility} being:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $H(t)$: intangible value of health, which affects the quality of life (health-related) without affecting mortality
    \item $u(c(t), l(t))$: utility to an individual, which in turn depends on
    \item $c(t)$: consumption, or the ability of an individual to purchase good or consume services
    \item $l(t)$: non-market or leisure time, that is the number of hours in a year an individual does not need to work and can enjoy their free time
    \item $\widetilde{S}(t,a)$: the probability of survival from age $a$ to $t$
    \item $\rho$: the discount rate or the rate of time preference
\end{itemize}

Under a perfect annuity market, the expected discounted value of future consumption corresponds to the expected wealth\cite{Murphy2006}, that is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:expected_wealth}
A(a) + \int_{a}^{\infty}{\left\lbrack y(t) - c(t) \right\rbrack\widetilde{S}(t,a)e^{- r(t - a)}dt = 0}
\end{equation}

In the equation the following terms appear:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A(a)$: the initial assets, or the wealth at age $a$
    \item $r$: the interest rate
    \item $y(t)$: the life-contingent income
\end{itemize}

We note that the life-contingent income $y(t)$ is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:income}
y(t) = w(t)\left\lbrack 1 - l(t) \right\rbrack + b(t)
\end{equation}

Where $w(t)$ is the wage per time period, $l(t)$ is the proportion of leisure time and $b(t)$ is a non-wage income, such as a pension, that is received without working-hours associated to generating it.

The key idea behind determining the value of a year of life to individual is to maximize the utility associated to the remainder of one's life, subject to the constraints due to the disposable capital, as the sum of the currently available assets and the future income. The value of life is calculated as the marginal rate of substitution between the instantaneous mortality hazard at age $a$, and the assets accumulated $A(a)$.

The corresponding value of residual life at age $a$ is then calculated as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:residual_life}
V(a) = \ \int_{a}^{\infty}{v(t)}\widetilde{S}(t,a)e^{- r(t - a)}dt
\end{equation}

Which is independent on the rate of time preference $\rho$ and where $v(t)$ is the value of a life year at age $t$, larger or equal than $a$. The value of a life year is in turn a function of the wage $w(t)$, the total working hours, leisure time and the marginal utility of consumption\cite{Murphy2006,Scott2021}.

Under this construct, the willingness to pay for changes in technological advancements $\xi$, such as those coming from the information coming from epigenetic clocks measuring the speed of aging -- in turn inducing lifestyle changes, or pharmaceutical that target the ageing process is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:wtp}
{WTP}_{\xi}(a) = \underbrace{\int_{a}^{\infty}{v(t)}\mathrm{\Delta}_{\xi}S^{*}(t,a)dt}_{\text{lifespan}} + \underbrace{\int_{a}^{\infty}{\frac{\mathrm{\Delta}_{\xi}H(t)}{H(t)}\frac{u(c(t),l(t))}{u_{c}(c(t),l(t))}}dt}_{\text{healthspan}}
\end{equation}

Where $S^{*}$ is the discounted survival, $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\xi}S^{*}$ and $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\xi}H$ denote the change in Survival and Health induced by the technological advancement $\xi$ and $u_{c}$ is the marginal utility of consumption. The expression contains independent terms that represent contributions to the willingness to pay with respect to changes in lifespan and healthspan.

\subsection{Linking Frailty to Health}

The above-mentioned studies by Scott and Topel presented changes in health as a function of changes in frailty via disability. In our work, we modeled health as a linear function of Frailty Index, as observed in previous studies that outlined the inverse relationship between Frailty Index and health related quality of life utility\cite{Nathiya2023}. We simplify these observations further and model health as $H(t) = 1 - FI(t)$.

We measure the outcomes of the model in terms of the number and proportion of individuals who are frail, have chronic diseases, or die at each age.
